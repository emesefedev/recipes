        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Pizza Margherita is a classic Italian pizza known for its simplicity and fresh flavors. It features a thin, crisp crust topped with a light tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and basil leaves. The pizza is typically baked in a wood-fired oven until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Named after Queen Margherita of Savoy, the colors of the pizza—red (tomato), white (mozzarella), and green (basil)—represent the Italian flag, making it a symbol of Italian cuisine.</p>

                1 teaspoon salt
            </li>
            <li>
                1 cup tomato sauce (preferably homemade or high-quality canned)
            </li>
            <li>
                8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced or torn into small pieces
            </li>
            <li>
                Fresh basil leaves (about 10-15 leaves)
            </li>
            <li>
                2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
            </li>

                Salt, to taste
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Activate Yeast: In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix Dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups of flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir to combine, adding more flour as needed until a soft dough forms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Knead Dough: Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
            </li>
            <li>
                First Rise: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare Tomato Sauce: If using homemade tomato sauce, prepare it now or warm the canned sauce gently.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slice Mozzarella: Slice or tear the fresh mozzarella into small pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to the highest setting, typically around 475-500°F (245-260°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shape Dough: Punch down the risen dough and divide it into 2 equal portions (for two pizzas). Roll out each portion on a floured surface to form a thin, round pizza crust.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add Sauce: Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza peel or a baking sheet dusted with flour or cornmeal. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add Cheese: Evenly distribute the mozzarella cheese pieces over the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add Basil and Oil: Tear fresh basil leaves and scatter them over the cheese. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch of salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake Pizza: Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (onto the pizza stone if using) and bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cool and Serve: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two. Slice and serve hot.
            </li>
