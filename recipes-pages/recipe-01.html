        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its layered structure and rich flavors. It typically consists of flat, wide pasta sheets alternated with layers of meat sauce, cheese, and sometimes vegetables. The meat sauce is usually made from ground beef or pork simmered with tomatoes, garlic, and herbs. The cheese layer often includes ricotta mixed with eggs and herbs, with mozzarella and Parmesan added for extra flavor and texture. Some variations might include a béchamel sauce or additional vegetables like spinach or mushrooms.</p>

        <p>Assembled in a baking dish, lasagna layers usually start with a thin layer of sauce, followed by pasta, meat sauce, and cheese, repeating until the dish is full. The top is often covered with a generous layer of cheese that browns and bubbles when baked. After baking, the lasagna is allowed to rest before serving, making it easier to cut into neat squares. The result is a hearty, comforting meal perfect for family dinners and gatherings.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the Noodles: If using traditional lasagna noodles, cook them according to the package instructions. Drain and lay them out on a towel to prevent sticking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sauté the Onion and Garlic: In a large skillet or saucepan, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the Meat: Add the ground beef (or beef and pork mixture) to the pan. Cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Drain excess fat if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add Tomatoes and Seasonings: Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and red wine (if using). Add the dried basil, oregano, thyme, salt, pepper, and sugar (if using). Simmer the sauce for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare the Cheese Mixture: In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Layering: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        First Layer: Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Top with 1/3 of the meat sauce. Add a layer of optional vegetables if using (spinach, mushrooms, zucchini).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repeat: Repeat the layers (noodles, ricotta mixture, meat sauce, vegetables) two more times, ending with a final layer of noodles.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Top Layer: Spread the remaining meat sauce over the top layer of noodles. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella and extra grated Parmesan cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover and Bake: Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil (to prevent sticking, you can lightly spray the underside of the foil with cooking spray). Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Uncover and Bake: Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rest: Allow the lasagna to rest for about 15 minutes before serving. This helps the layers set and makes it easier to cut.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve: Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired. Cut into squares and serve warm.
            </li>
        </ol>
